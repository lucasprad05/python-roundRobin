# python-roundRobin
Program that simulates the 'Round Robin' Process Scheduler for the Operating Systems course.

The code contains parts in English and Portuguese due to external reasons.

The program receives an input text file.

```
5
Processo A B C D
Tempo 8 5 6 7
Chegada 0 4 9 14
```

The number "5" is the Quantum limit.
Then, you have the following Rows:
- Name of Process = A B C D
- Time to complete each task
- Arrival time

It's possible to change the Quantum and add new process. Just remember to add time and arrival also :)
